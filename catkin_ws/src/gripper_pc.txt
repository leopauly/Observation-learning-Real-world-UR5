# Connecting the 2 finger gripper via USB

http://wiki.ros.org/robotiq/Tutorials/Control%20of%20an%20S-Model%20Gripper%20using%20the%20Modbus%20TCP%20Protocol

# Check for the connection port using (usually ttyUSB0) :
dmesg | grep tty
#Configure the serial port to avoid permission denied errors by adding yourself to the dialout group as follows:
usermod -a -G dialout YOURUSERNAME
# Restart the PC (logout and then login)

Option 1 - Use the modbus RTU commands directly ! as in the gripper.py script
Option 2 - Run the ROS package provided by robotiq

roscore
rosrun robotiq_c_model_control CModelRtuNode.py ttyUSB0 # This brings up the relevant topics
rosrun robotiq_c_model_control CModelSimpleController.py # Follow the commands to play with the gripper

# You can the move the gripper through a script by using the right command and publishing to the
# right topic as seen in the simplecontroller
